# Breast Cancer Cell Nuclei Analysis

## Overview
The breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv file contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate
(FNA) of breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.The first column is the 
ID number. The other columns are the ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus. I was tasked to analysis 
4 of the characteristics data into meaniningful information 

## Techniques Utilized
- **R Studio** – Used for Data Anaylsis.
- **Frequency** – Used to find how many times a each value within a characteristic Occured.
- **Relative Frequency** – Used to find how many times a each value within a characteristic Occured.
- **Cumualtive Frequency** – Used to find how many times a each value within a characteristic Occured.
- **Relative Cumulative Frequency** – Used to find how many times a each value within a characteristic Occured.
- **Write.csv** – creates CVS files of the data tables
- - **.rmd** – Creates the word doc based on my work done in R Studio
